There is an application for using a Vigenere's ciphers with GUI. I have made it with Python 3 and Tkinter and Regular expressions.

There is a language switching. With an English interface, you use an English alphabet for encrypting. It is similar to a case with a Russian language interface. I have made a micro article with a historical review of a Vigenere cipher. The latter is available in the 'Help' page.
